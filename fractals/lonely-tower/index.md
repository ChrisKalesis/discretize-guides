Upon entering the fractal take the _Mistlock Singularity_ and head out the starting room and follow the corridor to your right. Whilst moving down the corridor avoid the red AoEs on the ground, getting hit by a falling orb will apply <Effect name="Agony"/> and 5 stacks of <Condition name="Torment"/>. At the end of the corridor you will see Cerus standing in the Astral Purifier room.

## Astral Purifiers
Something

## Brothers
Once you have completed the Astral Purifier event, you can _/gg_ to respawn in the starting room. Leave the starting room, once again taking the _Mistlock Singularity_ if availible. However, this time turn left and move down the corridor. This time as well as the red orbs from before, you will also have to deal with Deimos's hands, that apply _insert effects here_. At the end of the corridor you will come to a room with the brothers Cerus and Deimos standing in.

<Information>
Providing you can deal with the mechanics, the easiest strategy to kill the brothers quickly (and get the achievement) is to pull them together.

## Eparch
Once you have defeated the brothers, take the portal to the final boss. Before fighting Eparch, you will have to kill some trash mobs. Once you have dealt with them you can _/gg_ again, to reset cooldowns and prestack boons while Eparch spawns. When ready aproach the white circle on the ground to enter the arena.

<Information>
There is no status reset upon starting a boss encounter in this fractal, so it is advisable to take advantage of the _Mistlock Singularity_ to prestack boons, since the fight mechanics require you to move and split shortly after entering combat.
