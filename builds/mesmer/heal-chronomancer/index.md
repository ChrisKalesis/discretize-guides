<Warning> 

This build is made for PuGs environments. More info about building effective team compositions can be found [here](/guides/teamcomp101/). It provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing and therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. Once the safety of a dedicated healer is no longer needed, you can move on to running e.g. [Power Boon Chronomancer](/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer/) and other alternative boon providing build options.  
 
</Warning>    


The <Specialization name="Chronomancer" text="Heal Boon Chronomancer"/> is able to provide permanently up to  25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, either <Boon name="Quickness"/> or <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and a majority of the required <Boon name="Swiftness"/> uptime. It also has on-demand access to <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Resistance"/>.

The build is very flexible and can be adapted to the encounter, instabilities, and the group you are playing with. Make sure to read through the situational tab for an explanation of the different utility skills. 

It offers a great amount of healing through Clone related traits like <Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Illusions"/>, Wells via <Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Mantras"/>, etc.

You'll provide boon removal through <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> in order to deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>.

<Warning>  

This build has a great boon uptime as long as you can generate Clones/Phantasms, while it struggles to provide long lasting boons during downtimes. 

Compared to <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> we recommend to start playing <Specialization name="Chronomancer" text="Heal Boon Chronomancer"/> as an <Boon name="Alacrity"/> provider until you reached a certain level of depth build knowledge.

Note that this build variant is optimized for 150 agony resistance and providing yourself with permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> in order to achieve 100% boon duration (utilising the additional 250  concentration of <Trait name="Chaotic Persistence"/>). 

If you have more Agony Resistance, feel free to swap out gear for additional Minstrel stats.

<Item id="99965"/> adds some <Effect name="Barrier"/> to the toolkit and has great synergy with <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> and the corresponding traits.

Using your Raid setup is possible, but you are going to loose some <Attribute name="Healing Power"/> and a decent amount of <Attribute name="Vitality"/> & <Attribute name="Toughness"/>. 

Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more gear variants!

| <Trait name="Temporal Enchanter" size="big" disableText/>   | Its main usage lays in the combination with <Skill name="Feedback"/> and <Trait name="Medic's Feedback"/> a maxed out rez potential as well as projectile mitigation.

### Alternative Weapons
Pistol is your strongest off-hand weapon when it comes to single target CC.

That being said, Focus can be played instead, if you need <Skill name="Into the Void"/> for 5 target add pulls & <Boon name="Swiftness"/>, or <Skill name="Phantasmal Warden"/> as projectile mitigation.

<Divider text="Skill usage"/> 

### Basics
To play <Specialization text="Heal Boon Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> you'll need to constantly create Clones/Phantasms.

Which can then be spent on Shatters, to trigger:
- <Trait name="Seize the Moment"/> or <Trait name="Stretched Time"/>
- <Trait name="Illusionary Defense"/>
- <Trait name="Bountiful Disillusionment"/> 
- <Trait name="Illusionary Membrane"/> + <Trait name="Chaotic Transference"/>.

The passive Clone generation gets covered by the third hit of your Scepter attack chain <Skill name="Ether Clone"/> and double casting of <Skill name="Illusionary Counter"/>.

<Skill name="Echo of Memory"/> has two instances and each can be used to create a Phantasm by blocking incoming hits, as well as <Skill name="Phantasmal Duelist"/>, which can used whenever you are on your secondary weapon-set.

<Skill name="Tides of Time"/> can be aligned with defiance breaks, but prevent holding it for too long, otherwise you could drop out on <Boon name="Might"/>.

<Skill name="Well of Action"/> grants 1/3 of your <Boon name="Might"/> application and <Boon name="Fury"/>, after a 3 second delay, so be careful of not missing out. 

### Shatters
<Skill name="Split Second"/> and <Skill name="Rewinder"/> should be used off cooldown, 
ideally with 3 active Clones.

The same can be applied to <Skill name="Time Sink"/>, 
as long as you keep it for defiance breaks.

<Skill name="Distortion"/> however should be held for emergency <Boon name="Stability"/>/<Boon name="Aegis"/>.

### Continuum Split
<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> rewinds all your skills back to the status they have been at while entering.

The durations depends on the amount of Clones spent.

If the last stack of one of your Mantras gets used during the Continuum Split, it does not get rewinded!

Use **all** Shatters for additional boons.

<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> gets the most value at Precasts and during combat, if you either need additional CC, <Boon name="Stability"/>/<Boon name="Aegis"/>, or burst heal.

<Divider text="Providing Boons"/>
<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
### Standard Boons
- <Boon name="Alacrity"/>
- <Boon name="Quickness"/>
- <Boon name="Might"/>
- <Boon name="Fury"/>
- <Boon name="Protection"/>
- <Boon name="Swiftness"/>
- <Boon name="Regeneration"/>

</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="6">
### Stability
<Skill name="Distortion"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Concentration"/> share <Boon name="Stability"/>,
as well as one stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/>. 

While <Skill name="Well of Precognition"/> and <Skill name="Signet of Illusions"/> (with <Trait name="Blurred Inscriptions"/>) only grant <Boon name="Aegis"/> to allies. 

### Aegis

### Sustained Healing
Every summoning of Illusions heals allies within a 360 radius.

Following the Basics above, already covers most of your sustained heal. 

Cast <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> whenever it gets back up to 2 charges, to make use of the 
<Boon name="Regeneration"/> provided by <Trait name="Metaphysical Rejuvenation"/>.

<Trait name="Restorative Mantras"/> and <Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/> add up to that, as most of your utility skill choices are going to fall into that category.

### Burst Heal/Condition Cleanse
After you initially ramped up your boons, try to safe up on Clones, to shatter these, in case of foreseeable damage threats. 

<Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/> can provide decent burst heal, if you manage your ressources wisely and the same applies on condition pressure, combined with <Skill name="Mantra of Resolve"/> or <Trait name="Sympathetic Visage"/>.

The remaining charges of <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> can help due to <Trait name="Mender's Purity"/> and <Trait name="Restorative Illusions"/>.
